Requirements
============

You need the MnSymbol fonts version 1.4 or better installed. They can be
obtained from CTAN (ftp://ftp.ctan.org).

You also need some program to convert the OpenType fonts into Type1
format. If you have the LCDF Typetools (http://www.lcdf.org/type/)
installed you can use one of the provided scripts:

o convert.sh  is a Unix script
o convert.bat is a DOS script

Files
=====

The MinionPro distribution is split into several archives. Which of them
you need depends on the version of the fonts you have installed. We
support three different versions of MinionPro:

o 001.000: This is the first version which can be found on, e.g., 
           the 'Adobe Type Classics for Learning' CD.
o 001.001: This is the version included with, e.g., the 
           'Adobe Font Folio Opentype Edition' CD.
o 002.000: This version is included in recent Acrobat Reader
           installations and is currently for sale.

If you have LCDF Typetools installed you can determine the version with
the otfinfo command. For example, for version 002.000 you get:

  $ otfinfo -v MinionPro-Regular.otf
  Version 2.012;PS 002.000;Core 1.0.38;makeotf.lib1.6.6565

In all cases you need the archive:

o scripts.zip

Depending on the font version you need *one* of the encoding file archives 

o enc-v1.000.zip
o enc-v1.001.zip
o env-v2.000.zip

Do not install several encoding file archives, they are mutually exclusive.

Depending on the amount of font shapes that you own you need to install

o metrics-base.zip: contains the metrics for Regular, Italic, Bold,
  and BoldItalic.
o metrics-full.zip: contains additional metrics for Medium,
  MediumItalic, Semibold, and SemiboldItalic.
o metrics-opticals.zip: contains additional metrics for the Capt, Subh, and
  Disp optical shapes.

For example, if you have only the fonts coming with Adobe Reader 7,
you have the base weights in font version 002.000. Then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base.zip
  enc-v2.000.zip

If you have all weights, but not the optical families, in version
001.001 then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base.zip
  metrics-full.zip
  enc-v1.001.zip

If you have all fonts in version 001.001 then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base.zip
  metrics-full.zip
  metrics-opticals.zip
  enc-v1.001.zip

Installing
==========

0) Select the directory you want to install the files into. Usually,
this will be the local TeX tree. You can determine its path via the
command

  $ kpsexpand '$TEXMFLOCAL'

In the following instructions we will assume that the path is

  /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local

1) Unpack the scripts archive into some working directory:

  $ mkdir /tmp/MinionPro
  $ cd /tmp/MinionPro
  $ unzip scripts.zip

2) Copy your OpenType font files into the otf directory.

  $ cp /some/path/*.otf otf

3) Convert the OpenType fonts into Type1 format:

  $ ./convert.sh

For MiKTeX execute

  convert.bat

4) Copy the generated Type1 fonts into your local TeX tree:

  $ mkdir -p /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local/fonts/type1/adobe/MinionPro
  $ cp pfb/*.pfb /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local/fonts/type1/adobe/MinionPro

5) Unpack the other archives directly into the TeX tree, for example:

  $ cd /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local
  $ unzip metrics-base.zip
  $ unzip metrics-full.zip
  $ unzip enc-v1.001.zip

(You do not have to unpack the scripts archive which was only needed for
step 3.)

6) If you have an old TeX distribution you might need to move the
encoding files and the map file into another directory:

  $ cd /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local
  $ mkdir -p dvips/MinionPro
  $ mv fonts/enc/dvips/MinionPro/* dvips/MinionPro
  $ mv fonts/map/dvips/MinionPro/* dvips/MinionPro

7) Add the line

  Map MinionPro.map

to your updmap.cfg. Refresh the file database and run updmap:

  $ mktexlsr
  $ updmap

(On recent teTeX distributions you might have to call updmap-sys instead
of updmap depending on in which tree you installed the files.)

8) If you get errors about insufficient memory you might need to
increase the values of font_mem_size and font_max in your TeX
configuration. For most distributions, these can be changed in the file
texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf. For MiKTeX the file is called miktex.ini.

9) You can find the documentation in

  /usr/share/teTeX/texmf-local/doc/latex/MinionPro/MinionPro.pdf

10) Happy TeXing!
